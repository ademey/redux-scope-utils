# API Module

The `api` module is a [ducks-like](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux) collection of actionCreators, selectors and a single reducer. It is designed to work in conjunction with
the [redux-api-middleware](https://github.com/agraboso/redux-api-middleware) to have scoped loading data.
